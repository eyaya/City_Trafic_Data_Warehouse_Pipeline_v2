# City Traffic Data Warehouse Using Airflow, Dbt, PostgreSQL and Redash: Part-I
## Introduction

I began implementing the scalable data warehouse pipeline using the specified technology stacks just this week, with the goal of sharing my learning experiences and the challenges encountered during the process.
Various technology stacks are available for building a data warehouse pipeline. In our case, we use Airflow to orchestrate the workflow, dbt for data transformation, and PostgreSQL as the data lake. The objective is to convert the collected and uncleaned data into a usable format for downstream parties in the traffic department. In the following, I will outline the step-by-step approach I have been taking thus far.
